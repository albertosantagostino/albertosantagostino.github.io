## A microblog about what? And why?
Let's keep this short, I will use this space to talk about **personal projects** I consider worth sharing.  
First thing to mention: usually my side projects have two possible evolutions:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="{{site.url | append: '/media/20200521/scenario_scheme_en.png'}}" title="Scenario A is the most frequent one, in an alternate reality" class="responsive" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
{: refdef}

Scenario **B** is the one I apply (unwillingly) most of the time. For this reason I will talk about my projects in no specific order and during different stages of ~~neglect~~ development.

Also, I believe in [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), so I hope to get new ideas or to discover mistakes I made in my work writing here and describing my projects to someone else :)

## Content, language, post frequency
All posts will be written in both **english** and **italian** (switch language from the bottom right corner).  
I've also set up a [RSS feed]({{site.url | append: '/rss'}}) for subscription.

There is no specific schedule for new posts, I will write when I have something to talk about! That being said, I hope to publish soon an article on **ITAQA**, a project on which I'm working lately!

Thanks for reading!
